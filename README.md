# Unit testing based on xUnit in .NET

This repo will delve into the critical practice of unit testing in software development and explore the benefits it brings to the implementation process. We’ll leverage the power of xUnit, a testing framework for .NET technology, to rigorously test our services. While this article offers a straightforward approach, it does not delve into the complexities of test-driven design. For a visual walkthrough, the YouTube video is available, and the code is accessible on GitHub. Let’s begin the journey of enhancing code quality through effective testing.
